## What is Argbash?

* Do you write `Bash` scripts that should accept arguments?
* But they don't since arguments support is a daunting task, because ...
* `getopt` is discouraged, `getopts` doesn't support long options, there is no widely-accepted `Bash` module to do the task and some solutions don't work on all platforms (Linux, OSX, MSW)...

Give a `Argbash` a try and stop being terrorized by those pesky arguments! With Argbash, you will get:

* Make your existing script powered by `Argbash` [in a couple of minutes](http://argbash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#generating-a-template)!
* Fast, minimalistic declaration of arguments your script expects (see below for supported argument types).
* Generate script from definitions once and use it afterwards on all platforms that have `bash`!
* Definitions will stay embedded in few lines of the script itself (so you can use `Argbash` to regenerate the parsing part of your script easily).
* Re-use low-level `Argbash`-aware scripts by wrapping them by higher-level `Argbash`-aware ones conveniently, without duplicating code.
* Easy installation (optional). Just [grab a release](https://github.com/matejak/argbash/releases), unzip it, go inside and run `cd resources && make install` (you may want to run `sudo make install PREFIX=/usr/bin` for a system-wide installation).
* [Documentation](http://argbash.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) and [examples](resources/examples).

## How does Argbash work?
----------

Argbash is not a parsing library, but it is rather a code generator that generates a library tailor-made for your script.
It lets you to describe arguments your script should take and then, you can generate the `bash` code.
You can either include in your script or let `Argbash` do it for you (in any case, from then on, you can forget about `Argbash` altogether).
`Argbash` is very simple to use and the generated code is relatively nice to read.
Moreover, argument definitions stay embedded in the script, so when you need to update the parsing logic, you just re-run the `argbash` script on the already generated script.

So by writing few comments to your script and running the Argbash's `bin/argbash` over it, you will get a `bash` script with argument parsing.
See the [simple example source template](resources/examples/simple.m4) and [simple example script](resources/examples/simple.sh) for the result.
If you are not into long reading, let `bin/argbash-init` generate the template for you.

Following argument types are supported:

- Positional arguments (defaults supported, possibiliy of fixed, variable or infinite number of arguments),
- optional arguments that take one value,
- boolean optional arguments,
- repeated (i.e. non-overwriting) optional arguments,
- incrementing (such as `--verbose`) optional arguments and
- action optional arguments (such as `--version`, `--help`).

The utility has been inspired by Python's `argparse` and the `shflags` project.

## Installing
------------

### Requirements:
- `bash` that can work with arrays (most likely `bash >= 3.0`) (the only requirement for *users* - i.e. people that only execute scripts and don't make them)
- `autom4te` utility that can work with sets (part of `autoconf >= 2.63` suite)
- basic utilities s.a. `sed`, `grep`, `cat`, `test`.
